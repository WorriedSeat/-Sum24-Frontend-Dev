                I was born in Volzhsky, Volgogradskaya Oblast, Russia. Throughout my childhood, I engaged in various sports
                including Judo, Football, Break-dance, and Volleyball. My academic pursuits also extended beyond the classroom; 
                I began studying the English language at the age of five, albeit with intermittent breaks. 
                Additionally, I delved into the field of robototechnics for two years and developed a 
                passion for programming from the ninth grade onwards. My self-taught journey in Python continued up until 
                the preparation for the Russian State Exam.

                Upon completing high school, I chose to further my education at 
                Innopolis University. The learning environment here is both challenging and engaging. Balancing my studies with physical 
                fitness, I dedicate most of my time to academics and gym workouts. However, I occasionally travel back home or to Moscow
                to spend quality time with my friends and family.
            </p>
            <p id="info">
                My primary interest lies in programming, particularly in backend 
                development and artificial intelligence. Beyond coding, I find joy in creative endeavors such as sketching.
